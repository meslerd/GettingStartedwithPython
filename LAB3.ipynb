    "I am not exactly sure what all is going on here, Python is brand new to me but from the list of notebooks given [EarthPy](http://earthpy.org/category/data-processing.html) looks interesting. This notebook uses the Scientific Python (scipy) stack tools to generate flow duration curves from current USGS NWIS data. Under \"Data Processing\", there is a notebook that is entitled, \"Flow duration curves from current USGS NWIS data\". Here, they describe a function that uses the ulmo package to retrieve U.S. Geological Survey surface water site data from the National Water Information System (NWIS) website. The function also puts the data from the website into a usable format. The function gets site information from NWIS, which includes site name, watershed size, and coordinates.Additionally, it generates a flow duration curve for hydrologic data. A flow duration curve is a percent point function (ppf), displaying discharge as a function of probability of that discharge occuring. The ppf is the inverse of the better known cumulative distribution function (cdf).\n",

    "Normally the lists are longer than list but the top 5 libraries according to, [PythonTips](https://pythontips.com/2018/06/03/top-14-most-famous-python-libraries-frameworks/) are: requests, tqdm, pillow, scrapy and numpy. PythonTips provides external links to each one of the libraries they list. To describe two of them, Requests allows you to Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests automatically (there’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data). Secondly, Pillow provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities (image archives, display, and processing). The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats.\n",

    "So from my understanding, it appears that there is a version of ggplot you can use in/with Python, named ggplot. According to [this site](https://www.r-bloggers.com/ggplot2-style-plotting-in-python/), the syntax is very very similar. [This site](https://medium.com/@gscheithauer/data-visualization-in-python-like-in-rs-ggplot2-bc62f8debbf5) describes how plotnine has very similar functions/applications as ggplot.\n",

    "Pandas appears to be the library that allows for dataframe wrangling similar to with R, in that it is designed to do work with “labeled” and “relational” data simple and intuitive. Apparently, it is designed for quick and easy data manipulation, aggregation, and visualization. [This site](https://pandas.pydata.org/) provides instructions on downloading this library.\n",
